This is a simple web proxy written in Perl back in 2001. It does a few
things:

* It blocks ads. Lots and lots of ads. If served from 2001-era ad
  servers.
* It caches images from popular sites like Slashdot. This should be
  really useful if you visit 2001-era sites, on a 2001-era connection
  when loading such common images is slow, with a 2001-era web browser
  which didn't do all that caching itself particularly well.
* It automates some tedious tasks from some online games. With all the
  above caveats. I actually didn't play online games much in 2001, but
  someone I knew did.

It's distributed under the same terms as Perl. It might be a useful
starting point if you'd like to write your own Perl proxy, in the
process of studying historical computer languages or something.
